      "I recently participated in a college hackathon, where I developed a Crowd Management project. The project focused on creating a system to efficiently monitor and manage crowds in real time, applying my skills in web development and problem-solving. It was an exciting experience that allowed me to collaborate, innovate, and see my ideas come to life under tight deadlines.",
